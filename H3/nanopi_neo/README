nanopi.org I guess mine is the older nanopi neo although the schematics
are not exactly the same but these are open source-ish hardware so
the one I got on ebay for $16 is probably...just a clone...

The schematics for the board if you figure out which you have, and more
important the Allwinner H3 datasheet can be found at nanopi.org for
this board.


then went to (stumbled upon)

dietpi.com

followed the instructions to make a dietpi sd card, only really want
uboot dont care for the rest (for bare metal).

[later I built a u-boot binary and didnt need dietpi, but still do
the setenve and saveenv after hitting a key, whichever path you choose]

1 gnd
2 5v
3 uart_tx
4 uart_rx

Using a 3.3v usb ftdi uart breakout works fine isnt getting hot.

Actually the silkscreen on the board says nanopi v1.2 and the debug
header, which is the only one on mine that came populated, is marked
and there is a legend on the board showing the pinout.

Hit any key when you plug it in, to get to the uboot prompt

setenv bootcmd echo hello
saveenv

Now when it powers on

and you can use the loads command to wait for an srec file download
(just do an ascii download of the .srec files that you build)

Dont know if/where there is a reset pin yet so have to power cycle per
run.


---- building u-boot ----

The top level readme shows a few toolchain solutions (in the TOOLCHAIN
file actually).  Well those are fine for making my baremetal binaries
but I recently built u-boot from sources and needed to do a little
more work

https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz

went to /opt as root and tar xvf interesting that it solved the what
do I do with .tar.xz

then set my path to use that directory

PATH=/opt/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin/:$PATH

went here

http://linux-sunxi.org/Mainline_U-Boot

did this

git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git

cd u-boot

did this version

git checkout v2016.11

export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
make nanopi_neo_defconfig
make u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin

using this

http://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card

Now you you have to find your card and replace /dev/sdz with
whatever yours is, no numbers, and umount first
mount or dmesg after inserting the card or plugging your card reader
into your linux computer will show the last thing is the card
you can do damage so not my fault if you get it wrong, this can
wipe out your hard disk for example if you get it wrong.

wipe out the partition table
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdz bs=1M count=1
sync
dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdz bs=1024 seek=8
sync

put it in the nanopi neo and power on.

and there is my modification autobootz

so it is running the one I built, not something left on the card from
dietpi or anything else.

My real interest is replacing u-boot with my own baremetal program
no dram or anything like that, there is sram on the card, but will
see if I get there.
