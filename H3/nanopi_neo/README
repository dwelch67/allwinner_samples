nanopi.org I guess mine is the older nanopi neo although the schematics
are not exactly the same but these are open source-ish hardware so
the one I got on ebay for $16 is probably...just a clone...

The schematics for the board if you figure out which you have, and more
important the Allwinner H3 datasheet can be found at nanopi.org for
this board.


then went to (stumbled upon)

dietpi.com

followed the instructions to make a dietpi sd card, only really want
uboot dont care for the rest (for bare metal).

1 gnd
2 5v
3 uart_tx
4 uart_rx

Using a 3.3v usb ftdi uart breakout works fine isnt getting hot.

Actually the silkscreen on the board says nanopi v1.2 and the debug
header, which is the only one on mine that came populated, is marked
and there is a legend on the board showing the pinout.



Hit any key when you plug it in, to get to the uboot prompt

printenv to see the environment

...
bootcmd=run loadsplash; run distro_bootcmd
...

setenv bootcmd_orig 'run loadsplash; run distro_bootcmd'
setenv bootcmd echo hello
saveenv

Now when it powers on

and you can use the loads command to wait for an srec file download
(just do an ascii download of the .srec files that you build)

Dont know if/where there is a reset pin yet so have to power cycle per
run.
