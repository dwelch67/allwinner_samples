I have a nanopi neo2.

Currently named the H5_User_Manual.pdf but is the full datasheet with
register specs.

I dont control these pages so obviously the above links and names
could change at any time.

So on my board, unlike the nanopi neo I have, the silkscreen
pinout is wrong, the webpage/schematic is right

1 uart_rx
2 uart_tx
3 5v
4 gnd

Using a 3.3v usb ftdi uart breakout works fine isnt getting hot.

You can go to dietpi for example and get an image that you dd
onto an sd card.  I find this easiest.

For building u-boot I used linaro.

https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest/aarch64-linux-gnu/
https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest/aarch64-linux-gnu/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz

went to /opt as root and tar xf interesting that it solved the what
do I do with .tar.xz

then set my path to use that directory

PATH=/opt/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/:$PATH

went here

http://linux-sunxi.org/Mainline_U-Boot

did this

git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git

cd u-boot

did this version

git checkout v2016.11

export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
make nanopi_neo2_defconfig
make u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin

(had to do some apt-gets that didnt make sense but did them and it worked)

using this

http://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card

Now you you have to find your card and replace /dev/sdz with
whatever yours is, no numbers, and umount first
mount or dmesg after inserting the card or plugging your card reader
into your linux computer will show the last thing is the card
you can do damage so not my fault if you get it wrong, this can
wipe out your hard disk for example if you get it wrong.

wipe out the partition table
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdz bs=1M count=1
sync
dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdz bs=1024 seek=8
sync

put it in the nanopi neo2 and power on.

and you can use the loads command to wait for an srec file download
(just do an ascii download of the .srec files that you build)

Dont know if/where there is a reset pin yet so have to power cycle per
run.

most of these programs you

=> loads
then ASCII/raw download the notmain.srec file
=> go 0x42000000

See the README in each directory to see if this varies.
