This is how we are booting in 64 bit mode, aarch64 instruction set.
Kinda the point for having this board IMO.

Unlike a raspberry pi 3 we dont have to "sort" the cores out.  Like
a sane chip (and maybe the pi3 chip is, but not how they use it from
the GPU bootloader), the individual core clock enable and reset lines
are separate in a register, so only one core is coming up.  We have
to figure out how to start the others...
